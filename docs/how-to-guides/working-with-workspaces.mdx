## Introduction

Every Webiny project is organized as a [monorepo](/docs/key-topics/project-organization/monorepo-organization) and as such, it consists of multiple packages, or in the context of monorepos, multiple workspaces.

Depending on the project size, a single monorepo can contain anywhere from a couple to dozens of packages. When the latter point is reached, executing different commands on packages, one by one, simply becomes ineffective. That's why, the [Webiny CLI](/docs/key-topics/webiny-cli) introduces the `workspaces` set of commands.

:::info Workspaces vs. Packages
Note that the terms **workspace** and **package**, essentially, refer to the same thing - an NPM package or in other words, a folder with a `package.json` file and some code. Check out the [Workspaces vs. Packages](/docs/key-topics/project-organization/monorepo-organization#workspaces-vs-packages) section in the [Monorepo Organization](/docs/key-topics/project-organization/monorepo-organization) key topic to learn more.

## The `workspaces run` command

Webiny CLI provides the `workspaces run` (or `ws run` for short) command that enables you to run a single command across multiple workspaces at once. The common use case where this might be needed is local development, where you want to watch for code changes on multiple packages, and rebuild them accordingly.

For example, in order to establish a watch session across multiple packages, located in a specific folder, you can run the following command:

```
yarn webiny ws run watch --folder ./awesome/packages
```

On the other hand, if you wanted to build all of the packages, again, located in a specific folder, you can run:
```
yarn webiny ws run build --folder ./awesome/packages
```

When deploying your project applications, building of packages is done automatically for you, as explained in the [Deploy Your Project](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-your-project#before-we-begin) tutorial.

### How It Works
Note that the `workspaces run` command runs the commands specified in the `webiny.config.ts` file, and not the scripts that might've been defined in packages' `package.json` file, in its `scripts` section.

The `webiny.config.ts` is almost always present in every package. For example, your React applications might have something like the following:

```ts title="webiny.config.ts"
const { createWatchApp, createBuildApp } = require("@webiny/project-utils");

module.exports = {
    commands: {
        async start(args, context) {
            // Starts local application development.
            const watch = createWatchApp({ cwd: __dirname });
            await watch(options);
        },
        async build(args, context) {
            // Creates a production build of your application, ready to be deployed to
            // a hosting provider of your choice, for example Amazon S3.
            const build = createBuildApp({ cwd: __dirname });
            await build(options);
        }
    }
};
```

All of the commands are listed in the `commands` property of the exported object.

### Specifying the Packages

In the above shown examples, we've used the `--folder` argument, to instruct the `workspaces run` to run the command only for packages located in the `./awesome/packages` folder. Instead of the `--folder` argument, you can also use the `--scope` argument, which enables you to filter the packages by their name. For example:

```
// Run the "watch" command on all packages whose name starts with "@webiny/".
yarn webiny ws run watch --folder @webiny/*

// Run the "build" command on packages "api-a", "api-b", and "api-c".
yarn webiny ws run build --folder api-{a,b,c}
```

### Additional Arguments

If a Webiny command you're trying to run expects additional arguments, you can pass them as usual. For example, for certain packages, the build command might expect the environment to be specified, via the `--env` argument. So, simply append it to the `workspaces run` command, like so:

```
yarn webiny ws run build --folder ./react-apps --env dev --custom-argument-1
```

### How It Works

Once executed, the `workspaces run` command first retrieves a list of all packages, specified via either the `--folder` or `--scope` argument. After that, the command requires the `webiny.config.ts`

## FAQ

#### What happens if the command doesn't exist in one or more packages?

If you're running a specific command for multiple packages, and some of the packages don't have it defined in its `webiny.config.ts`, those packages will simply be ignored. Ultimately, for each package, the command gets executed only if it's actually defined in the `webiny.config.ts`.

#### Can I add more commands in the `webiny.config.ts`?

Yes, you can. Feel free to expand it in any way needed.
