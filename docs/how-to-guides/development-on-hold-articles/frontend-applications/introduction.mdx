## Overview

The process of application development is much more than just writing code. It entails several different subprocesses, which are equally, if not more, important. For example:

- testing application code
- organizing VCS branches
- deployment into multiple environments
- application and cloud infrastructure security
- monitoring and observability <!-- (https://thenewstack.io/monitoring-vs-observability-whats-the-difference/) -->
