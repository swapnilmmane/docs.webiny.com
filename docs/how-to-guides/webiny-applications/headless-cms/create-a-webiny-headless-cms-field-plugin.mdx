## Overview

This guide should help you understand how to create Headless CMS field plugins and how to use them in the API and the UI. By going through this guide you can see how to create at least two plugins for your field - UI plugin and API plugin. There are extra API field type plugins that can help you with indexing (Elasticsearch) and storage of the field.

:::info Prerequisites
To use the instructions presented in this guide, you need to know how to register Webiny plugins. Please visit the [Importing Plugins](/docs/how-to-guides/importing-plugins) guide, if you're not already familiar with the process.

## Plugin Types

There are a few plugins types that you need to have in mind when creating a new field. For the UI part of the application, there are `CmsEditorFieldTypePlugin` and `CmsEditorFieldRendererPlugin`. For the API part of the application, there are `CmsModelFieldToGraphQLPlugin`, `CmsModelFieldToStoragePlugin` and `CmsModelFieldToElasticSearchPlugin`. It is required only to have `CmsModelFieldToGraphQLPlugin` to make the field work.

### UI plugins
#### CmsEditorFieldTypePlugin

Plugins of this type are defining the field for the UI part of the application.
Here is a simple example of the plugin:

```tsx
export default (): CmsEditorFieldTypePlugin => ({
  type: "cms-editor-field-type",
  name: "cms-editor-field-type-textEntry",
  field: {
    type: "largeText",
    label: `Large text`,
    description: `A text that can be extremely large, probably HTML or JSON.`,
    icon: <Icon />,
    allowMultipleValues: true,
    allowPredefinedValues: false,
    multipleValuesLabel: `Large texts`,
    createField() {
      return {
        type: "largeText",
        settings: {},
        validation: [],
        renderer: {
          // we leave this empty so renderer it is automatically chosen according to canUse() in the renderer plugin
          name: ""
        }
      };
    }
  }
});
```

This example adds a `largeText` type field to the UI which can be set to accept multiple values.

For more advanced examples, check either [text](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/de23b3428e0e280b86584db556a91013993dd6d0/packages/app-headless-cms/src/admin/plugins/fields/text.tsx) field type or [ref](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/de23b3428e0e280b86584db556a91013993dd6d0/packages/app-headless-cms/src/admin/plugins/fields/ref.tsx) field type.

#### CmsEditorFieldRendererPlugin

Plugins of this type are used to render a field in the create or update entry form in the UI side of the application.
A simple example of the renderer meant to render a `largeText` type field when set to allow multiple values.

```tsx
export default (): CmsEditorFieldRendererPlugin => {
    type: "cms-editor-field-renderer",
    name: "cms-editor-field-renderer-largeText-multiple",
    renderer: {
        rendererName: "largeTextRenderer",
        name: `Large texts`,
        description: `Renders multiple large text inputs.`,
        canUse({ field }) {
            return field.type === "largeText" && field.multipleValues;
        },
        render(props) {
            return (
                <>
                  <LargeText />
                  <LargeText />
                  <AddMore />
                </>
            );
        }
    }
};
```

You also must create a renderer for a field type `largeText` when not set to allow multiple values.

### API plugins
#### CmsModelFieldToGraphQLPlugin

Plugins of this type define GraphQL part for a field type in the API side of the application.
A simple example of the plugin:

```tsx
export default (): CmsModelFieldToGraphQLPlugin => ({
  type: "cms-model-field-to-graphql",
  name: "cms-model-field-to-graphql-largeText",
  fieldType: "largeText",
  isSortable: false,
  isSearchable: false,
  manage: {
    createInputField({ field }) {
      if (field.multipleValues) {
        return field.fieldId + ": [String]";
      }
      return field.fieldId + ": String";
    },
    createResolver({ field }) {
      return instance => {
        return instance[field.fieldId];
      };
    },
    createTypeField({ field }) {
      if (field.multipleValues) {
        return `${field.fieldId}: [String]`;
      }

      return `${field.fieldId}: String`;
    }
  },
  read: {
    createResolver({ field }) {
      return instance => {
        return instance[field.fieldId];
      };
    },
    createTypeField({ field }) {
      if (field.multipleValues) {
        return `${field.fieldId}: [String]`;
      }
      return `${field.fieldId}: String`;
    }
  }
});
```

Note that there can be differences in management and read definitions. That is because of a case that administration is working with data directly and the user on the read side expects a resolved field.

When you created `CmsEditorFieldTypePlugin`, `CmsEditorFieldRendererPlugin` and `CmsModelFieldToGraphQLPlugin` plugin types, your field is ready to be used. Just import them in the application.

#### CmsModelFieldToElasticSearchPlugin

Plugins of this type define transformations that are run on the field of a type before saving into Elasticsearch.
A kinda, simple example of the plugin:

```tsx
export default (): CmsModelFieldToElasticSearchPlugin => ({
  type: "cms-model-field-to-elastic-search",
  name: "cms-model-field-to-elastic-search-largeText",
  fieldType: "largeText",
  toIndex({ toIndexEntry, storageEntry, originalEntry, field }) {
    const value = toIndexEntry.values[field.fieldId];
    delete toIndexEntry.values[field.fieldId];
    return {
      values: toIndexEntry.values,
      rawValues: {
        ...toIndexEntry.rawValues,
        [field.fieldId]: JSON.stringify(value)
      }
    };
  },
  fromIndex({ entry, field }) {
    const value = entry.rawValues[field.fieldId];
    delete entry.rawValues[field.fieldId];
    return {
      values: {
        ...entry.values,
        [field.fieldId]: JSON.parse(value)
      },
      rawValues: entry.rawValues
    };
  }
});
```

Be aware that you must return top-level entry properties, for example, `values` or `rawValues`, merged with existing ones. Otherwise, you lose data. You can check the [richTextIndexing](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/74466282f9a4abd97421d8cf8a3122b5957f4576/packages/api-headless-cms/src/content/plugins/es/indexing/richTextIndexing.ts) plugin for more reference.

Inside the `toIndex` method, you can get the original entry (`originalEntry`), the one that was prepared for storage (`storageEntry`), and the one that is inserted into the Elasticsearch (`toIndexEntry`). You should not change them, but you can.
Inside the `fromIndex` method, you always get an entry (`entry`) that has possibly been modified by some previous Elasticsearch plugin.

#### CmsModelFieldToStoragePlugin

Plugins of this type are like the `CmsModelFieldToElasticSearchPlugin` plugin type, they just handle to and from storage transformations.
A simple example to store field as compressed value:

```tsx
export default (): CmsModelFieldToStoragePlugin => ({
  type: "cms-model-field-to-storage",
  name: "cms-model-field-to-storage-largeText",
  fieldType: "largeText",
  async fromStorage({ value }): Promise<any> {
    return ungzip(value);
  },
  async toStorage({ value }): Promise<string> {
    return gzip(value);
  }
});
```

You can check the [plugin](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/de23b3428e0e280b86584db556a91013993dd6d0/packages/api-headless-cms/src/content/plugins/fieldsStorage/richTextStorage.ts) for storing `richText` as `string` packed with `jsonpack` library as another example.
