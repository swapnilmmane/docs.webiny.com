## Description

<!-- vale off -->
The diagram gives an overview of the complete cloud infrastructure that's needed to host the **Website** project application and, in combination with the **API** project application, that makes prerendering of pages possible.
<!-- vale on -->

As we can see, the cloud infrastructure consists of five resources - two Amazon CloudFront distributions <diagram-letter>A</diagram-letter> <diagram-letter>D</diagram-letter>, two Amazon S3 buckets <diagram-letter>B</diagram-letter> <diagram-letter>C</diagram-letter>, and the **API** project application.

The **API** project application is included in the diagram because this is the application that's hosting the mentioned **Prerendering Service**, which coordinates the whole prerendering process.
