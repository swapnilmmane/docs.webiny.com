- how to upgrade Webiny from 5.11.0 to 5.11.1

:::

:::danger
Before continuing, make sure to take the necessary precautions, listed in the [Overview](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny#-precaution-measures) section.
:::

:::info
Make sure to check out the [5.11.1 changelog](/docs/release-notes/5.11.1/changelog) to get familiar with all the changes introduced in this release.

## 1. Upgrade Webiny Packages

Upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages by running the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.11.1"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.11.1`.

## 2. Deploy Your Project

Proceed by re-deploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```

:::caution
As stated in the [Upgrade Webiny](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny#pre-production-environments-first) section, we recommend that you first deploy your changes into one of your pre-production environments, like `dev` or `staging`.

:::tip
Learn more about different deployment environments in the [CI/CD / Environments](/docs/key-topics/ci-cd/environments) key topic.

## 3. Open Admin Area App

Finally, open the Admin Area app and execute the upgrade script when prompted. The upgrade process will remove the `password` attribute from all user records in your DynamoDB (for details, see the [changelog](/docs/release-notes/5.11.1/changelog#remove-password-attribute-from-dynamodb-1842)).
