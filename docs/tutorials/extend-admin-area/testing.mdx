## Introduction

While extending the generated GraphQL API application code, it's often a good idea to write different types of tests which ensure everything works as expected and also that we didn't break anything in the process.

That's why, as mentioned, with the generated GraphQL API application code, the scaffold also generates three example tests that you can expand or simply use as a reference in further development.

## Different Tests for Different Purposes

### [`typeDefs.unit.test.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.9.0/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/__tests__/typeDefs.unit.test.ts)

Unit tests are probably not something you're going to write too often. In theory, these tests should not talk to any external services, and should just ensure that isolated units in your code, like functions, classes, or class methods, work as expected. Because of this narrow scope, other types of tests often provide more value. Personally, I like to use these when I'm working on an important function that has to follow a specific business logic rules, and I want to ensure it works as expected.

The provided [`typeDefs.unit.test.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.9.0/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/__tests__/typeDefs.unit.test.ts) example test is simple - it ensures that the base [`CarManufacturer` GraphQL type](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.9.0/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/typeDefs.ts#L2-L9) exists in your GraphQL schema (defined in [`typeDefs.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.9.0/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/typeDefs.ts)). Probably not that useful, but still, we decided to include this example test, mainly for awareness purposes.

### [`crud.integration.test.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.9.0/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/__tests__/crud.integration.test.ts)

These are the tests that you'll probably write most often, as these interact with real cloud infrastructure resources. This means they are testing a bigger picture, and thus, can provide more value.

Notice the "real cloud infrastructure resources" part. Yes, in order to run these, in the serverless world, we actually have to deploy the needed cloud infrastructure resources, so that our application code can interact with them. Luckily, this is something Webiny can help you with.

You can start with the default setup and simply test against the cloud infrastructure resources that you've already deployed into the `dev` environment. But, down the road, you can also define a new, let's call it, `integration`, environment, and adjust the cloud infrastructure code to only deploy a specific set of resources that are needed for testing purposes. By reducing the number of necessary integration testing-related resources, you can make your tests run faster in your CI/CD pipeline, which is always a nice benefit to have.

And although our application code is interacting with real cloud infrastructure resources during the execution of an integration test, what is interesting here is that the application code is still being run locally on our machine. Which means we can use the native [Node.js Debugger](https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html) to travel line by line through the application code while it's running and inspect different values we might potentially be interested in. This can be of great help while we're working on a mew feature or if we simply need to debug a newly reported bug.

The provided [`crud.integration.test.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.9.0/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/__tests__/crud.integration.test.ts) integration example test ensures that the newly generated GraphQL query and mutation operations work as expected, by simply locally invoking our GraphQL API [handler function](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.9.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/api/code/graphql/src/index.ts). Creation of a new `CarManufacturer` entry, the update of an existing one, or paginating through a list of `CarManufacturer` entries are some of the assertions that are being made.

Note that, as you make changes to the application code, most probably, you will also need to make adjustments in this test as well.

### [`e2e.integration.test.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.9.0/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/__tests__/crud.e2e.test.ts)

Last but not least, end-to-end tests enable us not only to ensure our application code works correctly with real cloud infrastructure resources, but also that the resources that are set up around it, are working as expected.

For example, from our integration test, we may get an information that a specific GraphQL query is working as expected, but what good is that if the Amazon API Gateway isn't configured properly and users cannot even execute it?

Serverless development is not just about writing application code. It's also about configuring all of the serverless cloud infrastructure resources and services correctly. That's why, with end-to-end tests, we're essentially using our application as a real user would.

Note that this means the changes we make to our application code need to be deployed into the cloud. This is the opposite of what we had in the integration tests section, where we were running code locally. But again, luckily, with the [`webiny watch`](https://www.webiny.com/docs/how-to-guides/use-watch-command/) command, you can continuously deploy your changes as you make them, and re-run your end-to-end tests accordingly.

Unfortunately, unlike with our integration tests, here it's not recommended to partially deploy the testing cloud infrastructure resources. It's quite the opposite. Here, the resources should be deployed in a way that is as similar as possible to the setup we're using in production environment. The less difference there is, the higher level of confidence in our application we'll have.

If we were to open the [`e2e.integration.test.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.9.0/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/__tests__/crud.e2e.test.ts) example test, we could see that we're making very similar assertions to what we already had in the [`crud.integration.test.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.9.0/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/__tests__/crud.integration.test.ts) integration example test. But, this time, we're issuing HTTP requests with a [`graphql-request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-request) GraphQL client, directly to our deployed Amazon CloudFront distribution. This way, we ensure that both Amazon CloudFront and API Gateway are configured properly, and ultimately, that our GraphQL API returns a correct HTTP response to the user.

## Running Tests

Out of the box, within the `scripts` section in the root [`package.json`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.9.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/dependencies.json) file, we provide [four scripts](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.9.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/dependencies.json#L68-L71) you can run locally (while developing) and in your CI/CD: `test:unit`, `test:integration`, `test:e2e`, and `test`. Respectively, you can use these in order to run unit, integration, end-to-end, and all tests that you have in your Webiny project.
