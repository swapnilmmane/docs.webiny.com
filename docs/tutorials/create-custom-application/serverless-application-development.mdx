## Overview

For new developers and developers who haven't had the chance to work with serverless technologies before, serverless application development can definitely be surprising and sometimes even challenging.

So, before we start building our application, let's quickly outline some of the differences between the serverless and _traditional_ application development and, on a high level, what can we expect to encounter when starting out with serverless application development.

## TLDR

If you'd just like to get a short TLDR (too long; didn't read) and immediately [start with the tutorial](/docs/tutorials/create-custom-application/getting-started), here it is:

- essentially, backend local development is no longer possible - if our code interacts with a cloud infrastructure resource, we'll need to deploy it in order to ensure everything works as expected
- cloud infrastructure code makes deployments much easier - no manual steps needed (for example, clicking through the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/))
- cloud infrastructure and its code are as important as your application code
- developers don't have to be _scared_ or try to avoid understanding how the application works on the cloud infrastructure level
- the fact that serverless cloud infrastructure resources are charged based on usage and not uptime, makes the whole [developing in the cloud](/docs/tutorials/create-custom-application/serverless-application-development#developing-in-the-cloud) proposition an even more attractive option

## Developing in the Cloud

In _traditional_, non-serverless application development, usually, developers are able to spin up the whole application locally, on their machine. This is done via virtual machines, or alternatively via [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers, which help emulate the environment in which the actual production application is running.

With these technologies, developers start different backend services, APIs, and similar, to which the locally hosted frontend application may interact with.

That being said, the main difference between _traditional_ and serverless application development is that you can't really do that anymore. This is because serverless services often cannot be run on your local machine, they only exist in the cloud. Some of the examples are [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [Amazons SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), and so on.

Sure, there are different utilities that try to emulate the cloud and, sort of, enable local development. But, the main problem with these solutions is that they can't really keep pace with the developments happening in different clouds, and most importantly, will never be able to 100% emulate the actual service. This poses a problem because, while developing your application, it might seem everything works. But, when you deploy your application into the cloud, different issues may start to occur.

These are some of the reasons why Webiny advocates developing in the cloud and not locally, within the developer's machine. As we'll see, as soon as our application starts relying on additional cloud infrastructure resources, we'll need to deploy them. The same goes when it comes to writing integration or end-to-end (E2E) tests, which will be executed against real services deployed into our cloud (AWS) account.

## Application and Cloud Infrastructure Code

As mentioned in the [Introduction](/docs/tutorials/create-custom-application/introduction) section, applications built with Webiny consist of two fundamental pieces: **application** and **cloud infrastructure** code.

This is because, in order for our application to work as expected, except for the correct application code, we may also need to deploy one or more cloud infrastructure resources. For example, our application code can be run via [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), which may interact with other services, for example [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), or [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/). If one of these wasn't properly configured or not deployed at all, our application won't work as expected.

Manually configuring and deploying these is hard, especially when talking about multiple environments, a common requirement for every application. That's why, instead of setting everything up manually, we use cloud infrastructure code, which brings multiple advantages:

- no need to manually create cloud infrastructure resources, for example via the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)
- cloud infrastructure can easily be replicated into multiple environments
- the code is versioned
- essentially, by reading the code, we can get a good sense of what's used by our application
- and more

In this tutorial, we'll get to chance to work with both types of code, so we'll be able to get a better feel of how it all works together.

To deploy necessary cloud infrastructure, by default, Webiny relies on Pulumi, a modern infrastructure as code framework. To learn more, check out the [IaC with Pulumi](/docs/key-topics/deployment/iac-with-pulumi) key topic.

## Understanding the Application on the Cloud Infrastructure Level

Usually, in _traditional_ application development, developers are exclusively responsible for application code. Once the code is ready to be shipped, the DevOps teams then take over, making sure it and other moving parts are deployed correctly.

With serverless development, since the developers are now empowered to deploy cloud infrastructure resources and services in order to get the job done, the line between development and DevOps teams starts to blur a bit.

With that in mind, the main point we're trying to make here is: as a developer, you don't have to be _scared_ or try to avoid understanding how the application works on the cloud infrastructure level. Application code and cloud infrastructure are equally important in delivering the application you're building.

Sooner or later, you'll be faced with a task that will require you to introduce additional cloud infrastructure resource(s) into the mix. Sure, it's definitely not required of us to know everything about every available cloud infrastructure resource out there, but, having at least the basic knowledge of how our application works on the cloud infrastructure level definitely can't hurt.

Let's end this section with the following excerpt from this [Serverless is DevOps](https://www.stackery.io/blog/erverless-is-devops/) blog post:

> At a conceptual level, serverless application code and compute infrastructure become interchangeable -- as you change your code, you're fundamentally changing the underlying architecture of your application. This means that many operational concerns (latency, resiliency, etc) need to be addressed in the development cycle, which is a great starting point for integrating development and operations from the outset.

## The Advantage of Serverless - Consumption-based Pricing

One of the main advantages of serverless cloud infrastructure resources is their consumption-based pricing model. In other words, unlike with non-serverless resources, where you pay per minute or maybe per hour, serverless resources are charged based on their usage.

This goes hand in hand with serverless application development and everything we've outlined in the previous sections. In case the uptime-based pricing was used, developers' lives would be significantly harder because they would often get charged for things they potentially didn't even use that much. With serverless, zero usage means zero cost as well.

Furthermore, on top of the consumption-based pricing, today, different cloud infrastructure resources often include a solid free tier. In other words, completely free consumption until a certain threshold has been reached. Ultimately, this is what makes the whole [developing in the cloud](/docs/tutorials/create-custom-application/serverless-application-development#developing-in-the-cloud) proposition an even more attractive option.

:::caution
Before deploying additional cloud infrastructure resources, make sure to understand how they are priced. Consult with your team members if you're unsure what impact the deployment might make.
